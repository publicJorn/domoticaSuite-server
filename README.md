# Domotica Suite

> Build on top of [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/cloudmu/react-redux-starter-kit)

This project is part of a showcase where arduino's can give alerts to a server and that server will pass a message to
connected devices (eg. an Android app). The alert will only be silenced if the app acknoledges it.

There's a web interface for the server for setup, monitoring and testing the communication between devices.

:warning: If you are looking at this now, note that this is still in early development.
